# CODE_C_PRACTISE
This repository is dedicated to give insights on simple C language coding that we can do on day to day basis for improving competnecy.

NOTE: I have used STMCUBE IDE for this CODING practise, so that certain embedded C implementation like set /clear bit can be exercised using a target (STM32F407VG)
